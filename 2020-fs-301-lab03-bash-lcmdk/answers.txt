Question 1:
ls -al * showcases all the files in the directory with the date, time, and username. The * matches all files in the directory.
ls -al .* showcases all the files in the directory and previous directory. The .* matches all the files from the current directory and the previous directory.
rm -r .* and rm -rf / destroys all your files in the directory, and previous
directory

Question 2:
You would type ls -t to list by file modification time.
You would type cat -n to show line numbers when outputting a file.
The Whatis command displays one-line manual page descriptions.

Question 3:
file.txt now contains apple.
file.txt now contains banana. The > command just overwrites everything onto
the text file.
file.txt now contains banana and carrot. The >> command goes to the next line
and writes the string. It does not overwrite the entire file.
The output is 1      7      14. The | breaks the command, so it knows that
you want to use the wc command.
