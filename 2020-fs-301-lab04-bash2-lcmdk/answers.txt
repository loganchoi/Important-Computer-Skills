1a) ./compiley.sh program.cpp hello
1b) The script essentially takes two arguments.
    The first one is the program, and the second
    is the executable name. First, it uses calls a
    function, then it runs a compiler command 
    "g++ -o program executable".

2a)You can't compile with "my program.cpp"
2b)The output says that "my" is the first argument and
   "program.cpp" is the second argument.g++ can't 
   recognizae any files because there are no files
   "my" or "program.cpp", thus it can't compile.

3a)It does not work having single quotes.
3b)When you call the function, it thinks it is taking 
   '$@' literally. Thus, g++ can't recognize any files
   because there aren't any.

4a)The script does work now.
4b)Double quotes allow the script to understand you 
   want to use the arguments, and not $@ literally.
   It knows you want to use the file and executable
   name.
