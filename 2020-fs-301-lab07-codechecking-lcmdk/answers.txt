1.There is memory that is not being deallocated after use. nums_copy is being allocated in main(), but it isn't being freed once
you are done with the program. It is a memory leak. All you have to do is
just delete nums_copy.

2. The problem is that you aren't copying the array correctly. You have to
manually put in each element in the new array through a loop. If you don't,
you are accessing memory that hasn't really been allocated.
