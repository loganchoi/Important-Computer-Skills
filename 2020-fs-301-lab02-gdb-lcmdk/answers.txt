Q1: The print_vector function was causing the segfault. Specifically, line
48. You were trying to access memory that wasn't allocated. 

Q2: There was no break condition. The segfault was caused by that.
You needed to have (i < print_this.size()), so it will break. It kept
incrementing.

Q3: The infinite loop was caused because the 'i' was not being incremented. 


Q4: In the for-loop condition statment, you had "<=" instead of "<". This
will add one index too much.
